# Python project-for-Data-Science-IBM
This is the final project of the course "Python Project for Data Science" from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
Performed specific data science and data analytics tasks such as extracting data, web scraping, visualizing data and creating a dashboard. This project helped me to gain insights in Python and using libraries such as Pandas and Beautiful Soup within a Jupyter Notebook.
